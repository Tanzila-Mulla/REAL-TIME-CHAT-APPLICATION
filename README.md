Task 2 – Real-Time Chat Application: Description & My Experience

As part of Task 2 during my internship, I worked on building a Real-Time Chat Application, an engaging and practical project that helped me understand how live communication systems work behind the scenes. The objective of this task was to allow multiple users to send and receive messages instantly, simulating real-time communication, much like WhatsApp or Messenger.

To achieve this, I used WebSockets for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server. For the front-end, I used React.js, which made the UI dynamic and responsive. The back-end was powered by Node.js along with the Socket.IO library to manage WebSocket connections effectively.

I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my primary development tool, which helped me manage the project structure efficiently. With its helpful extensions like Prettier, Live Share, and built-in terminal support, VS Code streamlined the entire development process. Git integration also allowed me to version-control my code and collaborate more effectively.

The application’s features included user login with a nickname, joining a chat room, sending messages, and seeing messages from other users in real-time. Each message displayed the sender's name and timestamp, ensuring a proper conversational flow. I also added basic UI enhancements using CSS to make the chatbox look clean and modern.

One of the major challenges I encountered was handling message broadcasting correctly, especially when multiple users were connected. Understanding how Socket.IO handled connections and emitted events was a key learning point. I also learned how to manage user sessions, handle edge cases like disconnections, and prevent duplicate message rendering.

Debugging and testing the app with multiple clients was another important learning experience. I often opened multiple browser windows or used multiple devices to test real-time interaction and synchronization.

This task significantly improved my understanding of event-driven programming, state management, and network communication. It also boosted my confidence in building interactive, real-time web applications and gave me a solid foundation in using React with WebSocket technology.

Overall, building this real-time chat application was a fun and educational experience. It not only strengthened my coding and debugging skills but also taught me how to think like a full-stack developer, balancing front-end interactivity with real-time back-end logic. I'm proud of completing this task and excited to take on more advanced real-time projects in the future.
